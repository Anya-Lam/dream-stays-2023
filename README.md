This is a starter repository for the work experience week (27-01 June/July 2022) at Expedia Group. Use this repo to create a super simple react app about some dream stays.

## Pre-requisite

## Deploying the website

Create the static files for our website by running `npm run build` (If your on windows run `npm run build-windows`).

Ensure your static files have been created in `/docs` directory

Commit the files and push to your main branch.

Update your repository settings to Github pages hosting by going to the repository in Github -> Settings -> Pages -> Set the source to 'main' and the folder to 'docs' -> Save

Your website show now be available on the URL provided!

## Development

View the app locally by running `npm start`

## Building a website tutorial

Use the knowledge shared in the slide deck to complete these activities, eventually building your own dream stays website:

### Introduction

We're building a collection of websites, each site is dedicated to inspiring customers to visit location with a collection of "Dream Stays" in the local area For example, your location may be London and your dream stays may be The Ritz, Camping in Crystal Palace and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

We'll add content as we move through the exercises. Don't worry about the content being perfect, the final session is dedicated to adding any final touches to the site.

### Setup

1. To begin with, let's pick a location we want to focus on. Throughout the exercises we'll need to do some research and provide some information about the general area. Be creative! Pick a location you've always wanted to visit or that you might think would be an interesting location to visit with some cool dream stays.
2. When templating the repository, you can cal your repository anything you think makes sense (Remember it's public!), maybe something like "<your_location>-dream-stays" e.g "London-dream-stays"

:information_source: Remeber to save the file after each change, otherwise it won't be shown in the site locally!

### Lesson 1: HTML and CSS

1. First, let's add our location to the top of the page undeaneath the header. What html tag do you think is a good choice here, considering the page already has a `<h1>`?. Add the tag with you location as the content undeaneath the header in `App.js`

### Lesson 2: Javascript

### Lesson 3: React

### Lesson 4: Final additions and deployment
